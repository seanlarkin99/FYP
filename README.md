# This is a sample Web3 Dapp
A very basic smart contract is written to allow the minting of strings as NFTs.
Presuming the strings are a hex color code (eg. #FFFFFF = black) the front-end of the dapp will publish and display them.

# Created following a tutorial
This code was implemented following a [tutorial from DappUniversity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPbgjPPC1d0)

There were a few snags along the way as the tutorial is a couple of years old and some of the libraries were outdated.

As of the date of publishing this code is fully functional using the most up to date libraries.
